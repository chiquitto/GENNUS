# Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use each of the generative methods of GENNUS are provided below.

## MIRGAN

MIRGAN is a Generative Adversarial Networks-based approach designed to create synthetic Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) nucleotide sequences.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to [MIRGAN](mirgan/README.md).

## SMOTE_DNA

SMOTE_DNA is a Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE)-based adapted to generate synthetic nucleotide sequence data.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to [SMOTE_DNA](smote_dna/README.md).
