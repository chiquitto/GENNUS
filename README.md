# Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use each of the generative methods of GENNUS are provided below.

## MIRGAN

[**MIRGAN**](mirgan/README.md) is a Generative Adversarial Networks-based approach designed to create synthetic Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) nucleotide sequences.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to [MIRGAN](mirgan/README.md).

## SMOTE_DNA

[**SMOTE_DNA**](smote_dna/README.md) is a Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE)-based adapted to generate synthetic nucleotide sequence data.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to [SMOTE_DNA](smote_dna/README.md).

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**[Q1]** What Operation System (OS) do I need to use GENNUS?
  - We tested GENNUS in Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. However, we believe that GENNUS should work on any UNIX OS able to have all dependencies installed.
